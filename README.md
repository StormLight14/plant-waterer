# plant-waterer
Automatic plant waterer using Arduino!

## How the heck do I use this?
Connect your Arduino to your PC and open this project with the Arduino IDE, and upload it.

The pinout is very similar to this: https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/transistor-motor-control, except with 2 buttons for instant water, and resetting the timer. (Default to pins 3 and 2)
