# plant-waterer
Automatic plant waterer using Arduino!

## How the heck do I use this?
Connect your Arduino to your PC and open this project with the Arduino IDE, and upload it.

The pinout is very similar to this: https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/transistor-motor-control, except with one button for instantly watering, and one for resetting the watering timer. (Defaults to pins 3 and 2)

## What does it look like?
This, except you'll have the pump inside of a water source, and the tube will go to your plant!
